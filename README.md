Generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program in the United States.

## Background

![](Images/citi-bike-station-bikes.jpg)

As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike program, I am now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In my new role, I will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.
Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data [](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data)
However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so my first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

### Instructions
My task in this assignment is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find unexpected phenomena.
1: Design 2–5 visualizations for each discovered phenomenon (4–10 total). I have the flexibility to work within a timespan of my preference. If needed, I can also combine multiple datasets from various periods.
Here are some questions I might want to address:

**Dashboard 1:** Ridership Growth and Patterns
Visualization 1: Yearly Ridership Count by Station and User Type:
- Which station consistently sees the highest ridership, and does user type (member vs. casual) influence this trend?
Visualization 2: Yearly Ridership Count by User and Rideable Type:
- How does the preference for rideable type differ between regular and casual users over the years?
  Visualization 3: Weekly Ridership Count by User Type Over the Years:
- Is there a specific week or time of year where we see a spike in ridership among casual users compared to members?

**Dashboard 2:** Station Popularity and Ride Characteristics
Visualization 1: Top 10 Starting Stations by Ride Count, Differentiated by User Type:
- Which starting station is the most popular among casual users, and how does that compare to members' preference?
Visualization 2: Top 10 Ending Stations by Ride Count, Differentiated by User Type:
- Are there any ending stations that are significantly more favored by members than by casual riders?
Visualization 3: Average Distance Traveled in Miles:
- What's the typical distance that both user types prefer to travel on their rides?

**Dashboard 3:** Bike Utility and User Behavior
Visualization 1: Average Trip Duration by User Type and Rideable Type:
- Do regular members tend to ride for longer durations than casual riders on specific rideable types?
Visualization 2: Top 20 Most Ridden Bikes by Distance (in Miles) Between Stations:
- Which specific bike has traveled the furthest distance overall, and does its route preference indicate a trend?
Visualization 3: Daily Ride Counts by July 2022 - July 2023:
- Were there any notable daily spikes in rides between July 2022 and July 2023, and if so, what might have caused them?

2: Create the following visualizations for city officials:

**Map 1:** Popular Starting Bike Stations by Ride Count
- Which geographic region of the city consistently serves as the most popular starting point for riders?

**Map 2:** Popular Ending Bike Stations by Ride Count
- Are there any areas in the city where rides tend to end more frequently, perhaps indicating popular destinations or points of interest?

**Map 3:** Dynamic Popularity of Bike Stations Over Time
- How have the popular bike stations shifted between July 2022 and July 2023, and can we attribute this shift to any specific city developments or events?

Finally, I created my final presentation
- Created a Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.
