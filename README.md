Generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program in the United States.

## Background

![](Images/citi-bike-station-bikes.jpg)

As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike program, I am now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In my new role, I will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.
Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data [](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data)
However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so my first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

### Instructions
My task in this assignment is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find unexpected phenomena.
1: Design 2–5 visualizations for each discovered phenomenon (4–10 total). I have the flexibility to work within a timespan of my preference. If needed, I can also combine multiple datasets from various periods.
Here are some questions I might want to address:

Dashboard 1: Ridership Growth and Patterns
Visualization 1: Yearly Ridership Count by Station and User Type:
- Which station consistently sees the highest ridership, and does user type (regular vs. casual) influence this trend?
Visualization 2: Yearly Ridership Count by User and Rideable Type:
- How does the preference for rideable type (e.g., electric bike vs. traditional bike) differ between regular and casual users over the years?
  Visualization 3: Weekly Ridership Count by User Type Over the Years:
- Is there a specific week or time of year where we see a spike in ridership among casual users compared to regular members?
